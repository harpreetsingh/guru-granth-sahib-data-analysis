# Maps surface forms that are genuinely ambiguous to multiple possible

# This is essential for intellectual honesty: when a word has multiple
# valid interpretations in the GGS, we flag it rather than silently
# choosing one reading.
#
# Usage:
#   - Phase 1 (matching): Records BOTH entities with confidence=MEDIUM
#   - Phase 3 (tagging): May resolve using context

polysemy:
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ਰਾਮ (Ram) — the most analytically important polysemy
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # This is one of the most studied questions in Sikh scholarship:
  # when the Gurus say "Ram", do they mean the formless divine
  # or the avatar Ramchandra? The answer varies by context.
  ਰਾਮ:
    entities: [RAM, RAMCHANDRA]
    context_hints:
      - "When preceded/followed by nirgun markers (ਨਿਰੰਕਾਰ, ਅਕਾਲ, etc.), likely RAM (divine)"
      - "When in mythological narrative context (with ਸੀਤਾ, ਰਾਵਣ, etc.), likely RAMCHANDRA"
      - "In isolation or with devotional language, default to RAM (divine) — the dominant usage in GGS"

  ਰਾਮੁ:
    entities: [RAM, RAMCHANDRA]
    context_hints:
      - "Same as ਰਾਮ — oblique case variant"

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ਕਰਮ (Karam) — actions, deeds, or divine grace
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The word ਕਰਮ in the GGS can mean:
  # 1. Ritual actions (karm-kand, external religious acts — often critiqued)
  # 2. Divine grace/blessing (nadar, kirpa — a different concept entirely)
  # The distinction is crucial for the critique-of-ritual analysis.
  ਕਰਮ:
    entities: [KARAM]
    context_hints:
      - "When paired with negation (ਬਿਨੁ ਕਰਮ), likely means 'divine grace'"
      - "When in ritual context (with ਪੂਜਾ, ਤੀਰਥ, etc.), likely means 'ritual actions'"
      - "Note: single entity but with polysemous meaning flagged for manual review"

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ਗੁਰ / ਗੁਰੂ (Guru) — multiple referents
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # In the GGS, 'Guru' can refer to:
  # - The divine as Guru (universal teacher)
  # - The human Guru (the historical Sikh Gurus)
  # - The Shabad as Guru (the Word itself as teacher)
  # These are theologically interconnected but analytically distinct.
  ਗੁਰੂ:
    entities: [GUR, SATGUR]
    context_hints:
      - "When with ਸਤਿ prefix, maps to SATGUR"
      - "In general usage, maps to GUR (divine teacher concept)"
