# HARPREET-STYLE QUESTIONS

## I. Structural & Civilizational Questions

### 1. Lexical distribution of Indic vs Perso-Arabic divine names
- Per Guru
- Per Raga
- Across Ang progression
- Normalized per 1,000 lines

### 2. Does any Guru show statistically distinctive gravitation toward a divine lexicon cluster?
- Ram-heavy
- Hari-heavy
- Allah-heavy
- Gobind-heavy
- Devi/Chandi references

This is not theology -- it is stylistic gravitation.

### 3. Does the Perso-Arabic vocabulary cluster in certain Ragas?
- Is language tied to musical structure?
- Or is vocabulary evenly diffused?

### 4. Does the Sanskritic register increase or decrease over time?
Not doctrinal -- purely textual drift analysis.

### 5. Are Hindu deity names more often used:
- Alone?
- In philosophical abstraction?
- In narrative context?

## II. Nirgun vs Sagun Curiosity

### 6. What percentage of the text leans nirgun / sagun / mixed?
By:
- Author
- Raga
- Ang progression

### 7. Does Nirgun language co-occur with certain divine names more often?
- Is "Ram" mostly Nirgun usage?
- Is "Krishna" mostly narrative?
- Is "Allah" mostly universalist?

### 8. Is the text structurally collapsing Nirgun and Sagun distinctions?
Same line containing both abstract metaphysics and named deity.
Supports "non-dual devotional" thesis.

## III. Civilizational Integration Questions

### 9. When Allah appears, what percentage of those lines:
- Also contain Indic vocabulary?
- Contain critique-of-cleric markers?
- Contain universalist markers?

### 10. Are Islamic terms ever used in narrative mythic context?

### 11. Do goddess references (Durga, Kali, Lakshmi, Saraswati) cluster around particular authors?

## IV. Human Experience Questions

### 12. How often does the text reference:
- Equanimity
- Control of mind
- Detachment
- Ego dissolution
- Oneness

Relative to:
- Devotional language
- Emotional surrender

Quantify the "Stoic-Bhakti-Advaita triangle."

### 13. Is critique of ritual evenly distributed or clustered in specific Gurus?

### 14. Does musical setting correlate with devotional intensity?
- Certain Ragas heavier in Sagun language?
- Others heavier in metaphysical abstraction?

## V. Identity-Resilience Questions

### 15. Does the GGS structurally integrate multi-civilizational vocabulary in the same metaphysical frame?

### 16. Is there evidence of linguistic plurality without doctrinal fragmentation?

### 17. Is the distribution of divine names concentrated or diffuse?

## VI. The Most "Harpreet" Questions

### 18. Does "Ram" in GGS behave statistically more like:
- Nirgun Absolute
- Sagun Epic
- Generic Divine Name

### 19. What is the structural signature of "Aval Allah Noor Upaya" type lines?
- Universalist?
- Register-mixed?
- Cross-tradition fused?

### 20. Does the text behave more like:
- A Bhakti corpus
- An Advaita corpus
- A Stoic-ethical corpus
- Or something uniquely hybrid?

Quantitatively.
