# ADDITIONAL RESEARCH QUESTION CATEGORIES

*(Informed by academic themes from Sikh studies and scripture analysis)*

## XI. Musical / Raga Contextual Analysis

**Questions scholars ask:**

- How does the choice of raga influence the emotional/spiritual impact of lines?
- Are certain ragas associated with specific thematic clusters (e.g., devotion, praise, existential insight)?
- Do lexical patterns (e.g., divine vocabulary) vary by raga?
- Do certain raga sequences correlate with spiritual progression?

**Why it matters:**
The Guru Granth Sahib *is* a musical scripture -- word and melody are inseparable for meaning and practice.

## XII. Themes of Human Experience and Ethics

**Questions:**

1. What are the dominant ethical themes?
2. How often do lines reference compassion, equality, service versus doctrinal vocabulary?
3. What percentage of lines deal with human existential conditions (fear, desire, ego)?

## XIII. Interfaith / Interreligious Dialogue

**Questions:**

1. How often does the text address other religious categories directly (e.g., Hindu, Muslim, Jain, Yogi)?
2. In those lines, what is the argumentative stance (critique, dialogue, transcendence)?
3. Which Gurus engage more with "religious other" categories?

## XIV. Canon Formation & Canon Criticism

**Questions:**

1. Why were certain Bhagat hymns included?
2. Are there textual patterns that explain canon selection (e.g., thematic coherence)?
3. Do included Bhagat hymns show consistent vocabulary patterns with Guru bani?
4. How is canon authority linguistically constructed (e.g., words for 'Guru', 'teacher', 'authority')?

## XV. Poetic Form and Structure

**Questions:**

1. Can we detect regular rhythmic or metric structures computationally?
2. Are certain poetic meters associated with specific theological themes?
3. Do repetitions and refrains signal emphasis on mystical concepts?

## XVI. Theological Topology

**Questions:**

1. Count of lines that refer to liberation/union with God.
2. Patterns in lines dealing with memory, attention, and devotion.
3. Vocabulary network around soul vs ego vs divine.

## XVII. Dialogue with Philosophy

**Questions:**

1. Count of conceptual vocabulary linked to classic Indian philosophy (e.g., maya, karma, jivanmukti).
2. Comparison of those frequencies with epic or ritual tokens.

## XVIII. Audience & Performance Perspective

**Questions:**

1. Which lines appear most often as daily Hukamnamas?
2. Are certain conceptual clusters overrepresented in performance contexts?

## XIX. Semantic Clustering & Topic Modeling

**Questions:**

1. What are the emergent semantic clusters in the entire text (without prespecified lexicons)?
2. Can topic modeling show themes that are not captured by your lexicon?

## XX. Gender & Metaphor Studies

**Questions:**

1. How often do relational metaphors appear (lover-beloved)?
2. How often do feminine-coded metaphors appear?

## XXI. Reception & Identity in Diaspora

- How does the Guru Granth Sahib influence Sikh identity outside Punjab?
- Sociological layer, not text-internal.
