# 4. Register Density by Ang

[Back to Table of Contents](./ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md)

## Peak Density Locations

For each register dimension, the top angs with highest density reveal
where specific vocabulary concentrates in the scripture. The expanded
124-entity lexicon (346 aliases, 11 dimensions) provides finer-grained
detection than earlier analyses.

### Perso-Arabic Register (0.29% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1084 | 0.0327 | Maru (989-1106) |
| 1083 | 0.0288 | Maru (989-1106) |
| 1349 | 0.0232 | Parbhati (1327-1351) |

Perso-Arabic vocabulary peaks in Raag Maru (angs 1083-1084). This section
contains compositions by Kabir and other Bhagats that engage directly with
Islamic concepts. Ang 1349 in Parbhati also shows elevated Perso-Arabic usage.

### Sanskritic Register (30.21% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 273 | 0.4021 | Gauri (151-346) |
| 845 | 0.2313 | Bilaval (795-858) |
| 699 | 0.2202 | Jaitsri (696-710) |

The highest Sanskritic concentration is in Raag Gauri at ang 273, where over
40% of tokens are recognized Sanskritic entities. Gauri is one of the largest
raga sections and contains many compositions dealing with Vedantic philosophy.

### Nirgun Register (42.25% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 576 | 0.3080 | Vadhans (557-594) |
| 573 | 0.3062 | Vadhans (557-594) |
| 539 | 0.2822 | Bihagra (537-556) |

Nirgun vocabulary peaks in Raag Vadhans and Bihagra -- sections known for
deeply devotional compositions focused on the formless divine.

### Sagun Narrative Register (0.51% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1133 | 0.0154 | Bhairav (1125-1167) |
| 1390 | 0.0153 | Epilogue (1354-1430) |
| 1082 | 0.0152 | Maru (989-1106) |

Mythological/incarnation references are most concentrated in Raag Bhairav and
the Epilogue section, though even at their peak the density is very low (1.5%
of tokens). The expanded lexicon now includes goddess references (Durga, Lakshmi,
Sarasvati), Ramayana figures (Sita, Dasrath, Ravan, Valmik), and additional
Krishna-cycle characters (Kans, Gopi).

### Ritual Register (2.20% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 910 | 0.0380 | Ramkali (876-974) |
| 720 | 0.0298 | Bairari (719-720) |
| 574 | 0.0278 | Vadhans (557-594) |

Ritual vocabulary peaks in Raag Ramkali, which contains Sidh Gosht and other
compositions that directly engage with ascetic and ritual practices.

### Cleric Register (0.95% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 730 | 0.0609 | Suhi (728-794) |
| 908 | 0.0570 | Ramkali (876-974) |
| 909 | 0.0463 | Ramkali (876-974) |

References to religious authorities (Pandit, Qazi, Mullah, Brahmin, Siddh)
concentrate in Raag Suhi and Ramkali, consistent with compositions that
critique institutional religion.

### Ethical Register (5.46% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 285 | 0.0623 | Gauri (151-346) |
| 408 | 0.0556 | Aasaa (347-488) |
| 847 | 0.0443 | Bilawal (795-858) |

Ethical vocabulary (Five Thieves, virtues) peaks in Gauri and Aasaa -- large
raga sections with diverse compositions addressing inner moral psychology.

### Devotional Register (7.24% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 583 | 0.0811 | Vadhans (557-594) |
| 689 | 0.0681 | Dhanasri (660-695) |
| 561 | 0.0642 | Vadhans (557-594) |

Devotional vocabulary (bridal metaphor, love-longing) concentrates in Vadhans
and Dhanasri -- ragas associated with themes of separation and reunion.

### Oneness Register (2.0% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 144 | 0.0536 | Majh (94-150) |
| 1385 | 0.0395 | Epilogue (1352-1430) |
| 885 | 0.0324 | Ramkali (876-974) |

Non-duality markers peak in Majh, which includes Guru Nanak's foundational
compositions that assert divine unity.

### Scriptural Register (0.49% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 834 | 0.0179 | Bilawal (795-858) |
| 296 | 0.0174 | Gauri (151-346) |
| 1117 | 0.0154 | Tukhari (1107-1117) |

References to external scriptures (Vedas, Shastras, Puranas, Quran) are sparse
and distributed across multiple ragas.

### Identity Register (0.05% of lines)

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 477 | 0.0206 | Aasaa (347-488) |
| 951 | 0.0172 | Ramkali (876-974) |
| 1136 | 0.0163 | Bhairav (1125-1167) |

Explicit religious identity labels (Hindu, Musalman, Turk) are the rarest
register. Their scattered distribution confirms that identity-naming is not
localized to any single raga or section.

## Pattern

There is a clear positional clustering: Perso-Arabic vocabulary concentrates
in Maru, cleric/ritual critique in Ramkali and Suhi, Sanskritic philosophy in
Gauri, nirgun devotion in Vadhans/Bihagra, and devotional vocabulary in
Vadhans/Dhanasri. This is not random -- it reflects the thematic character
of each raga section and the compositions assigned to them.

The ethical, oneness, scriptural, and identity dimensions are distributed more
broadly across the corpus rather than clustering in specific ragas, reflecting
their pervasive role in the GGS's theological discourse.
