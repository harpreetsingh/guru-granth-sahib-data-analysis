## Peak Density Locations

For each register dimension, the top 3 angs with highest density reveal
where specific vocabulary concentrates in the scripture.

### Perso-Arabic Register

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1084 | 0.0327 | Maru (989-1106) |
| 1083 | 0.0288 | Maru (989-1106) |
| 1349 | 0.0232 | Parbhati (1327-1351) |

Perso-Arabic vocabulary peaks in Raag Maru (angs 1083-1084). This section
contains compositions by Kabir and other Bhagats that engage directly with
Islamic concepts. Ang 1349 in Parbhati also shows elevated Perso-Arabic usage.

### Sanskritic Register

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 273 | 0.4021 | Gauri (151-346) |
| 845 | 0.2313 | Bilaval (795-858) |
| 699 | 0.2202 | Jaitsri (696-710) |

The highest Sanskritic concentration is in Raag Gauri at ang 273, where over
40% of tokens are recognized Sanskritic entities. Gauri is one of the largest
raga sections and contains many compositions dealing with Vedantic philosophy.

### Nirgun Register

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 576 | 0.3080 | Vadhans (557-594) |
| 573 | 0.3062 | Vadhans (557-594) |
| 539 | 0.2822 | Bihagra (537-556) |

Nirgun vocabulary peaks in Raag Vadhans and Bihagra -- sections known for
deeply devotional compositions focused on the formless divine.

### Sagun Narrative Register

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1133 | 0.0154 | Bhairav (1125-1167) |
| 1390 | 0.0153 | Epilogue (1354-1430) |
| 1082 | 0.0152 | Maru (989-1106) |

Mythological/incarnation references are most concentrated in Raag Bhairav and
the Epilogue section, though even at their peak the density is very low (1.5%
of tokens).

### Ritual Register

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 910 | 0.0380 | Ramkali (876-974) |
| 720 | 0.0298 | Bairari (719-720) |
| 574 | 0.0278 | Vadhans (557-594) |

Ritual vocabulary peaks in Raag Ramkali, which contains Sidh Gosht and other
compositions that directly engage with ascetic and ritual practices.

### Cleric Register

| Ang | Density | Raga Section |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 730 | 0.0609 | Suhi (728-794) |
| 908 | 0.0570 | Ramkali (876-974) |
| 909 | 0.0463 | Ramkali (876-974) |

References to religious authorities (Pandit, Qazi, Mullah) concentrate in
Raag Suhi and Ramkali, consistent with compositions that critique
institutional religion.

## Pattern

There is a clear geographic clustering: Perso-Arabic vocabulary concentrates
in Maru, cleric/ritual critique in Ramkali and Suhi, Sanskritic philosophy in
Gauri, and nirgun devotion in Vadhans/Bihagra. This is not random -- it
reflects the thematic character of each raga section and the compositions
assigned to them.
