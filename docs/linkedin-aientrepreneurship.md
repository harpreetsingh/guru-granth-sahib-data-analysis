## Title
I Gave ChatGPT and Claude Code a 500-Year-Old Sacred Text and a Weekend. I Just Brought the Questions.

## Body

(I will skip the obligatory, how far AI has come but it is important to note that it has come far enough for a non-data scientist to even have the confidence to attempt the analysis, let alone deliver it)

I've wanted to analyze the Guru Granth Sahib (The Sikh holy book) since my early 20s.

1,430 pages. 60,629 lines. Six languages. All in Gurmukhi (Punjabi) script—a script I can't fluently read.

The interpretation of this text was always outsourced to clerics. That felt like being illiterate about my own tradition.

This long weekend, I finally did it.

Not because I became a data scientist. Because the AI stack finally caught up.

ChatGPT wrote my PRD. Claude Code built the pipeline. Four AI agents ran parallel execution tracks. I brought the questions—124 theological entities, 11 dimensions, 10 iterations of bias-checking.

The result: a reproducible NLP pipeline with 733 tests and 60,012 entity matches. The entire project -- code, pipeline, and the full Guru Granth Sahib as structured JSONL -- is open source. 60,629 lines, every entity tagged, traceable to its source page. Anyone can query it.

Two decades. One weekend. Four agents :-).
