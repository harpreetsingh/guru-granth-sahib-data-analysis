# 7. Cross-Register Mixing

[Back to Table of Contents](./ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md)

## Perso-Arabic / Sanskritic Register Overlap

| Category | Lines |
|----------|-------|
| Perso-Arabic only | 398 |
| Sanskritic only | 15,587 |
| Both registers on same line | 43 |
| **Mixing rate** | **0.3%** |

Of the 16,028 lines that contain register-specific vocabulary, only 43 (0.3%)
contain *both* Perso-Arabic and Sanskritic terms on the same line.

This extremely low mixing rate shows that **the GGS generally keeps its
registers separate at the line level.** When a line uses Islamic vocabulary,
it rarely also uses Sanskritic terms, and vice versa. Register mixing happens
at the composition or ang level (as shown in the co-occurrence analysis),
not within individual lines.

The 43 mixed lines are significant precisely because they are so rare -- they
likely represent deliberate rhetorical choices where both traditions are
explicitly contrasted or unified.

## Nirgun / Sagun Interplay

| Category | Lines |
|----------|-------|
| Nirgun only | 23,087 |
| Sagun narrative only | 179 |
| Both nirgun + sagun | 66 |

The nirgun-sagun relationship is profoundly asymmetric:

- **Nirgun lines outnumber sagun lines 129:1**
- Only 66 lines contain both registers
- When sagun narrative appears (245 total lines with any sagun marker), 27%
  of those lines (66/245) also contain nirgun vocabulary

This confirms a well-known characteristic of the GGS: **sagun (incarnation)
references almost never stand alone.** When the Gurus mention Krishna, Shiv,
or Brahma, they typically do so in the context of nirgun teaching -- using
narrative to illustrate formless truth rather than as standalone devotion to
a particular deity.

## Implications

The mixing patterns support the scholarly understanding that the GGS:

1. **Is overwhelmingly nirgun in orientation** -- formless divine theology
   dominates by a wide margin
2. **Uses Sanskritic vocabulary extensively** but recontextualizes it within
   nirgun theology rather than endorsing Vedantic practice
3. **Engages with Islamic vocabulary selectively** and in specific
   compositional contexts (Kabir, Farid, compositions in Maru and Tilang)
4. **Subordinates sagun narrative to nirgun theology** -- mythology serves
   as illustration, not as independent devotional content
