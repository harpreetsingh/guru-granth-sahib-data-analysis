## The Nirgun/Sagun Play: Using Narrative to Illustrate Formless Truth

The most important structural finding in the mixing analysis: **sagun
(incarnation) references almost never stand alone.** When the Gurus mention
Krishna, Shiv, Brahma, Sita, or Ravan, they typically do so in the context
of nirgun teaching -- mythology serves as *illustration of formless truth*
rather than as standalone devotion to a particular deity.

- Nirgun lines outnumber sagun lines **112:1**
- When sagun narrative does appear (311 lines), **27% of those lines also
  contain nirgun vocabulary** (83 co-occurring lines)
- The complete Ramayana cast (Sita, Dasrath, Ravan, Lachman, Hanuman)
  appears in only ~72 lines combined

This is the GGS's distinctive rhetorical strategy: mythological figures are
invoked not as objects of worship but as teaching devices. "Even Brahma, Vishnu,
and Shiva do not know the divine" is a characteristic nirgun argument that
*uses* sagun vocabulary to *assert* nirgun theology.

## Perso-Arabic / Sanskritic Register Overlap

| Category | Lines |
|----------|-------|
| Perso-Arabic only | 152 |
| Sanskritic only | 18,297 |
| Both registers on same line | 22 |
| **Mixing rate** | **0.12%** |

Of the 18,471 lines that contain register-specific vocabulary, only 22 (0.12%)
contain *both* Perso-Arabic and Sanskritic terms on the same line.

This extremely low mixing rate shows that **the GGS generally keeps its
registers separate at the line level.** When a line uses Islamic vocabulary,
it rarely also uses Sanskritic terms, and vice versa. Register mixing happens
at the composition or ang level (as shown in the co-occurrence analysis),
not within individual lines.

The 22 mixed lines are significant precisely because they are so rare -- they
represent deliberate rhetorical choices where both traditions are
explicitly contrasted or unified. These are the "Aval Allah Noor Upaya" type
lines -- moments of explicit civilizational synthesis.

## Nirgun / Sagun Interplay

| Category | Lines |
|----------|-------|
| Nirgun only | 25,535 |
| Sagun narrative only | 228 |
| Both nirgun + sagun | 83 |

The nirgun-sagun relationship is profoundly asymmetric:

- **Nirgun lines outnumber sagun lines 112:1**
- Only 83 lines contain both registers
- When sagun narrative appears (311 total lines with any sagun marker), 27%
  of those lines (83/311) also contain nirgun vocabulary

This confirms a well-known characteristic of the GGS: **sagun (incarnation)
references almost never stand alone.** When the Gurus mention Krishna, Shiv,
Brahma, Sita, or Ravan, they typically do so in the context of nirgun
teaching -- using narrative to illustrate formless truth rather than as
standalone devotion to a particular deity.

## Implications

The mixing patterns support the scholarly understanding that the GGS:

1. **Is overwhelmingly nirgun in orientation** -- formless divine theology
   dominates by a 112:1 margin over sagun narrative
2. **Uses Sanskritic vocabulary extensively** but recontextualizes it within
   nirgun theology rather than endorsing Vedantic practice
3. **Engages with Islamic vocabulary selectively** -- only 174 lines total,
   concentrated in specific compositions (Kabir, Farid, compositions in
   Maru and Tilang)
4. **Subordinates sagun narrative to nirgun theology** -- mythology serves
   as illustration, not as independent devotional content
5. **Achieves multi-traditional character through composition-level
   juxtaposition, not line-level blending** -- the 0.12% mixing rate
   confirms this structural strategy
