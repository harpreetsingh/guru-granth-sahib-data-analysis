My background:
- curious about the Sikh text but since it is written in Gurmukhi (and 13 other languages). Understanding it is hard. It meant that the interpretation of the key messages of the text is handed off to other people. In the last decade or two, I felt that the interpretation was hijacked intentionally to drive a wedge between Hindus and Sikhs. So I wanted to see - what the text had to actually say. 
- I wrote the PRD with ChatGPT and code with Claude. I did multiple rounds of revision to make sure my biases didn't come in. At this time PRD and interpretation both have gone through 10 iterations aeach
- I am not a data scientist so if there are issues, the project is OSS. Please file a bug and I will look into it. People are more than welcome to fork the project. 
- - Methodolgy of analysis was recommended by Claude Code
- We worked on the direct text so no intermediary analysis and filter could come in. 
  
- My interests
    - GGS is a unique religious scripture in multiple ways
        - Multiple Gurus have written it over a period of 200 years. It is the only text that can say the Prophets/Guru have written it so there is no mis-interpretation
        - It is the only text that has lessons from Saints from the other religions in it. I wanted to understand, what % of the contribution came from others.
        - It is written in poetry format. Each poem (shabad) has a musical raga (musical composition) associated with it. The ragas are meant to evoke an emotional response. Thus, it is the only text that has tied not only the words but the emotions that the Gurus wanted it to invoke in text.
        - It is a text that is primarily Non-Dual (Nirgun) - IOW, it talks of God as this nameless, formless, energy. In todays world, this would be called the Quantum Field. The Dualistic (Sagun) or Gods is way to get to the formless. I wanted to see what % of the text was like that.
        - I wanted to understand what % of text was Sanatan(Hinduism) influenced. What was the Islamic influence. I was glad that I was able to answer it
    - Along the way, I was able to answer additional questions that Claude/ChatGPT popped up on what was possible given the dataset. 
    - Analyzing this text has been on my mind since I was in my early 20s. It is phenomenal that the advancements in AI have made this possible today -- for a person who doesn't read punjabi well, isn't a data scientist - this was a 2-3 day long weekend project.
- With that lets get into the results.
